# This project enables these features for most non-interactive commands:
# * Invoke less if output is connected to stdout and is more than one screen
# * Convert input if possible to text,csv, or ascii graphic in readable format
#   videos will be played in ascii output, music will be played
# * Pipes are not affected by moar (except for conversion)
# * Moar-ified commands can be disabled by prepending backslash: '\' : eg. \grep

# detect _QUACKLOOK_DIR
