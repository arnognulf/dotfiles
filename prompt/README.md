==================

![Terminal showing four different gradient colored prompts loaded.](images/screenshot.png)

Monorail is a simple and beautiful shell prompt with customizable gradient colors.

Install
=======

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/
cd ~/.config

# my dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/arnognulf/dotfiles

```

Add the following line to .bashrc:

```
. ~/.config/dotfiles/prompt/prompt.sh
```

Changing colors
===============
Run `bgcolor` to change background
```
bgcolor fffaf1
```

Run `fgcolor` to change foreground
```
fgcolor 444444
```

Run `gradient` to change prompt gradient:
```
gradient  0 b1e874  100 00d4ff
```
The `gradient` command has a simple syntax which gives an easy translation of gradients from https://cssgradient.io/ and https://uigradients.com.

Run `gradienttext` to change prompt gradient text:
```
gradienttext  0 ffffff  100 444444
```


Favicon titles
==============
![Multiple tabs where each tab has their own emoji icon](images/favicons.png)

Use an emoji in the title as a favicon so the context of the terminal tab can be easily visualized even if the full text is not shown.


Different folders have their own icons, being in a git folder shows the construction icon for instance.


Icons can be added to apps with aliases:

```
alias vim="_ICON 📝 vim"
```

Timing statistics
=================
![Long running command finished with statistics, and popup visible](images/timing.png)

By default, long-running commands (> 30s) are measured and will emit a popup notification and audible beep when finished.

To disable statistics for a command, create an alias with the `_NO_MEASURE` function as follows:

```
alias top='_NO_MEASURE _ICON 📈 top'
```

Supported shells

Tested on bash 5.2.


ZSH is not supported (help wanted!).

FAQ
===
Q: Gradient turns grey or disappears mid-line/mid-text, why?


A: The gradient look-up-table may be malformed. Verify that all elements have three parameters in the range of 0-255, separated by semicolons ';', eg. "64;29;128".
